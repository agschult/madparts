Make sure you have macports from macports.org.

In a Terminal, execute:

sudo port install boost
sudo port install py27-pyside
sudo port install py27-numpy
sudo port install py27-opengl
sudo port install py27-beautifulsoup4
sudo port install py27-pil

You need to build pyv8 from source. (TODO document)

copy PyV8.py and _PyV8.so to your source tree.

Execute 'make osx'

An madparts.app directory will be made in dist/

Compress this .app directory to distribute or just execute it as an osx app.
