 Madparts has as key features:
  * a footprint is a small program, giving you huge expressiveness
  * import from, export to eagle CAD libraries

    of pads
  * instant graphical feedback with continuous compilation process
  * easy collaboration because footprints are separate files and
    libraries are just directories
