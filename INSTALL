Linux
=====

Install the following packages via your distribution package manager:

* python (tested with 2.7)
* numpy (tested with 1.6.2)
* pyside (tested with 1.1.1)
* python-opengl (tested with 3.0.1) 
* beautiful soup 4 (tested with 4.1.0)
* libboost-python1.49.0

The following two are not yet provided by distributions so they
are provided as part of the madparts download for now:

* pyv8 (http://code.google.com/p/pyv8/)
* pyftgl (http://code.google.com/p/pyftgl/) (tested with 0.5c)

Just unpack the madparts tar file and run the madscripts
script contained in it.

Hopefully in the future madparts and it's dependencies will be packaged
to be part of your favorite linux distrubution.
