Linux
=====

Install the following packages via your distribution package manager:

* python (tested with 2.7)
* numpy (tested with 1.6.2)
* pyside (tested with 1.1.1)
* python-opengl (tested with 3.0.1) 
* beautiful soup 4 (tested with 4.1.0)
* python-imaging (tested with 1.1.7)

The following two are not yet provided by distributions.

For wheezy x86_64 a download is provided that contains these
libraries pre-compiled and is ready to run.

Other linux variants will have to build these libraries from
source:

* pyv8 (http://code.google.com/p/pyv8/)
* pyftgl (http://code.google.com/p/pyftgl/) (tested with 0.5c)

After that just unpack the madparts tar file and run the madscripts.py
script contained in it.

Hopefully in the future madparts and it's dependencies will be packaged
to be part of your favorite linux distrubution.
